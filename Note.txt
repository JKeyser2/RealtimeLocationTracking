Strange Bug:

If you are getting a nullptr that is making the code crash, that is because the GPS value I am trying to obtain is not
working. I'm assuming it is a permission glitch. Comment out lines 170-338 and run the code. Uncomment the lines and
run the code again. The GPS should now be working.
